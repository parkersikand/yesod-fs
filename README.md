Yesod-FS
========

This is a simple rewrite of [this Yesod Tutorial](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/advanced-haskell/building-a-file-hosting-service-in-yesod)
to use MongoDB instead of STM memory.

This code can serve as a quick and dirty example of getting something working with Yesod and the MongoDB driver library.

I created this project simply to play with Haskell, Yesod, and MongoDB
